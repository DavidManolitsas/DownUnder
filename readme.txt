Project Description:
We designed a travel website for Australia to aid tourists in planning for their trip to Australia. It aims to show potential visitors when the peak times for visiting specific states and territories of Australia are. The website displays a map of Australia and users are able to click on each state or territory and a pop up will display. In this pop up, the user has the ability to choose a month and view the average number of visitors that usually visit that location, or they can choose a year to view a graph of the number of visits per month.

There is also the additional functionality of choosing a language to translate some information on the page in order to cater to a global audience. Furthermore, we allow users to upload an image if they desired to identify the location of a landmark in Australia.
